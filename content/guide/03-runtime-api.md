title: Runtime API
---

The `sapper/runtime/app.js` module contains functions for controlling your app and responding to events.

Currently only one function, `init`, is exposed. Others will be added in future versions.


### init(selector, routes)

* `selector` — a string representing the element to render pages to, typically `'#sapper'`
* `routes` — an array of route objects generated by Sapper

This configures the router and starts the application — listens for clicks on `<a>` elements, interacts with the `history` API, and renders and updates your Svelte components.

```js
import { init } from 'sapper/runtime/app.js';
init('#sapper', __routes__);
```
