title: Runtime API
---

The `sapper/runtime/app.js` module contains functions for controlling your app and responding to events. More functions will be added in future versions.


### init(selector, routes)

* `selector` — a string representing the element to render pages to, typically `'#sapper'`
* `routes` — an array of route objects generated by Sapper

This configures the router and starts the application — listens for clicks on `<a>` elements, interacts with the `history` API, and renders and updates your Svelte components.

```js
import { init } from 'sapper/runtime/app.js';
init('#sapper', __routes__);
```


### goto(href, [options])

* `href` — the page to go to
* `options` — can include a `replaceState` property, which determines whether to use `history.pushState` (the default) or `history.replaceState`). Not required

Programmatically navigates to the given `href`. If the destination is a Sapper route, Sapper will handle the navigation, otherwise the page will be reloaded with the new `href`. (In other words, the behaviour is as though the user clicked on a link with this `href`.)
